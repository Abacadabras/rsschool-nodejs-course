**Important information**

I implemented the way that paths can be passed using quotes, so if you want you can do like this:

cd "D:\dev\rsschool\test test"

mv "D:\dev\rsschool\test test" "C:\New directory"

Commands to use the project:

```bash
npm run start -- --username=your_username
```
There is also a script with default parameters.
```bash
npm run test
```
